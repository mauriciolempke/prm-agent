- **E5**: Sets technical direction for projects, mentors on best practices
- **E6**: Defines technical standards, influences architecture
- **E7**: Shapes org-level technical strategy
- **E8+**: Sets company-wide technical direction

### 3. Direction
**What**: Vision, strategy, technical leadership

- **E3**: Executes on given direction
- **E4**: Provides input on technical direction
- **E5**: Sets direction for projects/areas
- **E6**: Defines direction for teams/products
- **E7**: Sets org-level strategy
- **E8+**: Company-level strategic direction

### 4. People Impact
**What**: Mentoring, collaboration, team development

- **E3**: Collaborates effectively, learns from others
- **E4**: Mentors junior engineers, strong collaborator
- **E5**: Mentors multiple engineers, builds team capability
- **E6**: Develops senior engineers, builds high-performing teams
- **E7**: Develops leaders, shapes org culture
- **E8+**: Industry thought leadership

### 5. Org Impact
**What**: Organizational improvements, cross-team influence

- **E3**: Contributes to team processes
- **E4**: Improves team workflows and practices
- **E5**: Cross-team collaboration, process improvements
- **E6**: Org-level process/tooling improvements
- **E7**: Multi-org influence, significant org change
- **E8+**: Company-wide organizational impact

## Key Questions by Level

### For E3 (Learning & Growing)
- Are they executing tasks independently?
- Are they learning and applying feedback?
- Are they collaborating effectively?
- Are they demonstrating technical growth?

### For E4 (Strong Contributor)
- Do they own features end-to-end?
- Do they handle ambiguity well?
- Are they mentoring junior engineers?
- Do they make sound technical decisions?

### For E5 (Senior Leadership)
- Do they lead significant projects?
- Do they set technical direction?
- Do they have measurable product impact?
- Are they developing other engineers?

### For E6 (Staff)
- Do they drive multi-quarter initiatives?
- Do they influence architecture?
- Do they coordinate across teams?
- Do they develop senior engineers?

### For E7+ (Principal+)
- Org/company-level strategic impact?
- Technical thought leadership?
- Building leaders and culture?
- Industry influence (E8+)?

## Rating Calibration by Level

### What "Exceeds Expectations" Means

- **E3**: Consistently delivers like E4, starts showing E4 capabilities
- **E4**: Shows E5 impact, leads projects independently
- **E5**: Demonstrates E6 scope, technical leadership across teams
- **E6**: E7-level org impact, strategic influence
- **E7+**: Operating at next level scope and impact

### What "Meets Expectations" Means

- Operating solidly at current level
- Consistent performance across all areas
- Meeting scope and impact expectations
- Growing in role

### What "Needs Improvement" Means

- Not meeting expectations for current level
- Gaps in key areas (impact, technical, collaboration)
- Need for focused development

## Common Pitfalls by Level

### E3
- ❌ Not asking for help
- ❌ Not learning from feedback
- ❌ Inconsistent code quality

### E4
- ❌ Not owning end-to-end
- ❌ Avoiding ambiguity
- ❌ Not mentoring

### E5
- ❌ Too narrow scope
- ❌ Not setting direction
- ❌ Insufficient product impact

### E6
- ❌ Not coordinating cross-team
- ❌ Insufficient technical influence
- ❌ Not developing senior engineers

### E7+
- ❌ Not operating at org/company level
- ❌ Insufficient strategic impact
- ❌ Not building leaders

## Usage for Sherlock

When analyzing performance data:

1. **Check level context**: Use employee level to calibrate expectations
2. **Ask level-appropriate questions**:
   - E3: Focus on execution, learning, growth
   - E5: Focus on leadership, project impact, technical direction
   - E6+: Focus on scope, strategic impact, organizational influence
3. **Assess evidence against level**:
   - Does the impact match level expectations?
   - Is scope appropriate for level?
   - Are capabilities demonstrated at-level or above?
4. **Rate accordingly**:
   - (+) if demonstrating next-level capabilities
   - (=) if solidly at-level
   - (-) if not meeting level expectations

## Usage for The IRS

When reviewing the draft:

1. **Calibration questions should match level**:
   - Don't expect E3 to show org-level impact
   - Don't accept E6 showing only E4-level scope
2. **Challenge scope claims**:
   - "Is this impact significant for an E5?"
   - "Does this demonstrate E6-level technical leadership?"
3. **Verify evidence matches level**:
   - E3: Task completion, code quality
   - E5: Project leadership, technical decisions, measurable impact
   - E6+: Multi-team coordination, architectural influence
4. **Rating justification**:
   - Does thesis support rating for this level?
   - Are "why not higher/lower" explanations level-appropriate?

---

**Key Principle**: Expectations scale with level. What's exceptional for E3 may be baseline for E5.
