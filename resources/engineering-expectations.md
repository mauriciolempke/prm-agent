# Generic Engineering Expectations Framework

Reference guide for Sherlock and The IRS agents.

**Purpose**: This is a sample expectations framework. Replace with your organization's specific leveling and expectations framework.

---

## Engineering Levels (Generic Example)

| Level | Title | Scope |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Junior/IC1** | Software Engineer | Individual contributor, learning phase |
| **Mid/IC2** | Software Engineer | Strong individual contributor |
| **Senior/IC3** | Senior Software Engineer | Senior contributor with broader impact |
| **Staff/IC4** | Staff Software Engineer | Technical leadership, significant scope |
| **Senior Staff/IC5** | Senior Staff Software Engineer | Org-level impact |
| **Principal/IC6** | Principal Engineer | Multi-org/company-wide impact |
| **Distinguished/IC7** | Distinguished Engineer | Industry-leading impact |

**Note**: Replace these with your organization's actual levels and titles (e.g., L3, L4, L5 or Grade 1, Grade 2, etc.).

## Expectations by Category (Customizable)

The following categories are examples. Replace with your organization's performance framework categories. These should align with the custom categories you define using the Sorting Hat agent.

### 1. Key Accomplishments / Project Delivery
**What**: Delivery of projects, features, and outcomes

- **Junior/Early Career**: Executes on defined tasks, delivers small features
- **Mid-Level**: Owns features end-to-end, handles ambiguity
- **Senior**: Leads projects, delivers significant product impact
- **Staff**: Drives multi-quarter initiatives, cross-team coordination
- **Principal+**: Org/company-level strategic initiatives

### 2. Technical Skills / Engineering Excellence
**What**: Technical quality, architecture, best practices

- **Junior/Early Career**: Writes clean code, learns best practices
- **Mid-Level**: Demonstrates technical depth, makes sound design decisions
- **Senior**: Sets technical direction for projects, mentors on best practices
- **Staff**: Defines technical standards, influences architecture
- **Principal+**: Shapes org/company-level technical strategy

### 3. Leadership & Mentoring / People Development
**What**: Mentoring, collaboration, team development

- **Junior/Early Career**: Collaborates effectively, learns from others
- **Mid-Level**: Mentors junior engineers, strong collaborator
- **Senior**: Mentors multiple engineers, builds team capability
- **Staff**: Develops senior engineers, builds high-performing teams
- **Principal+**: Develops leaders, shapes org culture, industry thought leadership

### 4. Cross-functional Collaboration / Org Impact
**What**: Organizational improvements, cross-team influence

- **Junior/Early Career**: Contributes to team processes
- **Mid-Level**: Improves team workflows and practices
- **Senior**: Cross-team collaboration, process improvements
- **Staff**: Org-level process/tooling improvements
- **Principal+**: Multi-org/company-wide organizational impact

**Important**: The categories above are examples. You should customize these to match:
1. Your organization's performance framework
2. The custom categories you create with the Sorting Hat agent
3. Your company's leveling philosophy

## Key Questions by Level

### For Junior/Early-Career Engineers
- Are they executing tasks independently?
- Are they learning and applying feedback?
- Are they collaborating effectively?
- Are they demonstrating technical growth?

### For Mid-Level Engineers
- Do they own features end-to-end?
- Do they handle ambiguity well?
- Are they mentoring junior engineers?
- Do they make sound technical decisions?

### For Senior Engineers
- Do they lead significant projects?
- Do they set technical direction?
- Do they have measurable product impact?
- Are they developing other engineers?

### For Staff/Lead Engineers
- Do they drive multi-quarter initiatives?
- Do they influence architecture?
- Do they coordinate across teams?
- Do they develop senior engineers?

### For Principal+ Engineers
- Org/company-level strategic impact?
- Technical thought leadership?
- Building leaders and culture?
- Industry influence (for most senior levels)?

## Rating Calibration by Level

### What "Exceeds Expectations" Means

- **Junior**: Consistently delivers like mid-level, starts showing next-level capabilities
- **Mid-Level**: Shows senior-level impact, leads projects independently
- **Senior**: Demonstrates staff-level scope, technical leadership across teams
- **Staff**: Principal-level org impact, strategic influence
- **Principal+**: Operating at next level scope and impact

### What "Meets Expectations" Means

- Operating solidly at current level
- Consistent performance across all categories
- Meeting scope and impact expectations
- Growing in role

### What "Needs Improvement" Means

- Not meeting expectations for current level
- Gaps in key areas (impact, technical, collaboration)
- Need for focused development

## Common Pitfalls by Level

### Junior/Early-Career
- ❌ Not asking for help
- ❌ Not learning from feedback
- ❌ Inconsistent code quality

### Mid-Level
- ❌ Not owning end-to-end
- ❌ Avoiding ambiguity
- ❌ Not mentoring

### Senior
- ❌ Too narrow scope
- ❌ Not setting direction
- ❌ Insufficient product impact

### Staff/Lead
- ❌ Not coordinating cross-team
- ❌ Insufficient technical influence
- ❌ Not developing senior engineers

### Principal+
- ❌ Not operating at org/company level
- ❌ Insufficient strategic impact
- ❌ Not building leaders

## Usage for Sherlock

When analyzing performance data:

1. **Check level context**: Use employee level to calibrate expectations
2. **Ask level-appropriate questions**:
   - Junior: Focus on execution, learning, growth
   - Senior: Focus on leadership, project impact, technical direction
   - Staff+: Focus on scope, strategic impact, organizational influence
3. **Assess evidence against level**:
   - Does the impact match level expectations?
   - Is scope appropriate for level?
   - Are capabilities demonstrated at-level or above?
4. **Rate accordingly**:
   - (+) if demonstrating next-level capabilities
   - (=) if solidly at-level
   - (-) if not meeting level expectations

---

## Usage for The IRS

When reviewing the draft:

1. **Calibration questions should match level**:
   - Don't expect junior engineers to show org-level impact
   - Don't accept staff engineers showing only mid-level scope
2. **Challenge scope claims**:
   - "Is this impact significant for a senior engineer?"
   - "Does this demonstrate staff-level technical leadership?"
3. **Verify evidence matches level**:
   - Junior: Task completion, code quality
   - Senior: Project leadership, technical decisions, measurable impact
   - Staff+: Multi-team coordination, architectural influence
4. **Rating justification**:
   - Does thesis support rating for this level?
   - Are "why not higher/lower" explanations level-appropriate?

## Customization Instructions

**To adapt this for your organization:**

1. **Replace level names**: Change "Junior/Mid/Senior/Staff" to your org's levels (e.g., L3, L4, L5 or E3, E4, E5)
2. **Update titles**: Use your organization's job titles
3. **Customize categories**: Replace example categories with your org's performance framework categories
4. **Align with Sorting Hat**: Ensure categories match those you use when categorizing data
5. **Add company-specific expectations**: Include any unique expectations or cultural values

**Example company-specific additions:**
- Specific technical competencies (e.g., "Cloud Architecture", "Security")
- Company values integration (e.g., "Customer Obsession", "Innovation")
- Domain expertise requirements (e.g., "Financial Systems Knowledge" for fintech)

---

**Key Principle**: Expectations scale with level. What's exceptional for a junior engineer may be baseline for a senior engineer.
