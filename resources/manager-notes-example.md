# Manager Notes Guide

## Purpose

This is your **unfiltered, uncategorized collection point** for all performance-related observations about an employee. The PRM Agent workflow will help you organize, analyze, and synthesize this raw data into a polished performance review.

**Key Principle**: Don't worry about format, structure, or categorization. Focus on **completeness and detail**. The agents will handle the rest.

# Manager Notes - [Employee Name]

**Review Period**: [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Role**: [Job Title]
**Level/Grade**: [If applicable - e.g., Senior Engineer, Staff, Principal, L5, IC4, etc.]
**Manager**: [Your Name]

---

## Quick Start: What to Capture

Capture **everything** related to the employee's performance during the review period. Think of this as your raw notes file that you'll add to continuously. The agents will later help you:
- Organize items into categories
- Add context and evidence
- Rate contributions
- Write the final review

### What to Include:

✅ **Projects & Deliverables** - What they worked on and shipped
✅ **Technical Contributions** - Code, designs, architecture, tools
✅ **Collaboration & Teamwork** - How they worked with others
✅ **Leadership & Influence** - Technical decisions, mentoring, direction-setting
✅ **Problem Solving** - Critical situations handled
✅ **Growth & Learning** - Skills developed, feedback applied
✅ **Strengths** - What they do exceptionally well
✅ **Development Areas** - Where they can grow
✅ **Feedback from Others** - Quotes, comments, praise, constructive input
✅ **1:1 Notes** - Key discussions and observations
✅ **Significant Moments** - Incidents, achievements, turning points
✅ **URLs & Links** - References to work (documents, code, posts, tickets)

## How to Use This Document

### 1. Write Freely - No Structure Required

You don't need to organize items into specific categories. Just capture what you observe:

**Example - Unstructured Entry:**
```
March 15: Jane led the API redesign kickoff meeting. Coordinated with 3 teams
(backend, mobile, infrastructure). Created clear design doc. Everyone praised
how thorough it was. Project shipped 2 weeks early in May. Reduced latency
by 40%. Product team loved it.
```

The agents will later help you:
- Extract the key points
- Add missing context/evidence
- Categorize appropriately
- Rate the contribution

### 2. Add Detail - Be Generous with Information

The more detail you provide, the better the final review will be. Include:

- **What**: What did they do?
- **When**: When did it happen?
- **How**: How did they do it? What was their approach?
- **Why**: Why did it matter?
- **Who**: Who was involved? Who benefited?
- **Metrics**: Any numbers, percentages, time frames?

**Example - Detailed Entry:**
```
Q2: John mentored Sarah (junior engineer, started in January). Met weekly,
helped her with system design concepts. Sarah's code review quality improved
significantly - went from 2-3 rounds to 1 round average. Sarah told me John's
patient teaching style really helped her confidence. John also created
onboarding docs for the team that we're now using for all new hires.
```

### 3. Capture As You Go - Continuous Updates

Don't wait until review time. Add notes after:
- 1:1 meetings
- Project completions
- Receiving feedback from others
- Observing significant contributions
- Team meetings where they stood out
- Incidents or challenging situations

---

## Example Raw Notes

Here's what a manager's raw notes file might look like. Notice there's no strict format - just detailed observations:

---

### January

**Project Kickoff (Jan 10)**
Alex proposed the new caching architecture for our API layer. Presented to the team, got buy-in from everyone. Really clear thinking on trade-offs between Redis and Memcached.

**1:1 Note (Jan 18)**
Discussed career goals - wants to work on more cross-team projects. I suggested leading the authentication migration coming up in Q2.

**Feedback from Maria (Product Manager)**
"Alex is the best engineer I've worked with for collaboration. Always responds quickly, explains technical constraints clearly, and finds creative solutions when we have product/tech conflicts."

---

### February

**Code Review Quality**
Noticed Alex's code reviews are consistently excellent. Thorough, educational, and kind. New engineer Tom mentioned how much he's learning from Alex's reviews.

**Production Incident (Feb 23)**
Database connection pool exhausted, API went down for 30 minutes. Alex immediately jumped in even though it was 11pm. Diagnosed the issue, deployed fix, wrote detailed postmortem. Really impressed by the calm leadership under pressure.

**Technical Debt Initiative**
Without being asked, Alex identified our biggest tech debt issues and created a roadmap to address them. Presented to leadership, got approved for Q3 execution. Shows great ownership and initiative.

**Team Process Improvement**
Noticed our on-call was burning people out. Proposed rotating schedule + better runbooks. Implemented it. Team feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.

---

### May

**API Launch Success**
Project shipped! Cross-team collaboration was excellent. No major issues post-launch. Error rate stayed below 0.1%.

**1:1 Note (May 20)**
Alex feeling good about the project success. Discussed next steps - wants more architecture work. Talked about potential Staff promotion path.

**Peer Feedback**
Collected 360 feedback. Common themes:
- "Best technical communicator on the team"

**1:1 Note (Aug 15)**
Discussed promotion - Alex is ready for Staff level. Scope and impact are clearly there. Will start packet prep.

---

### October - December

**Cross-Team Leadership**
Led working group on API standards across engineering org (5 teams). Got everyone aligned on consistent patterns. This will make integration way easier going forward.

**Growing Others**
Sarah (mentee) got promoted! Alex's mentorship was a big factor. Sarah's manager reached out to thank Alex specifically.

**Year-End Reflection**
Looking back, Alex had an exceptional year:
- Led major technical initiative (API redesign)
- Improved team processes (on-call, documentation)
- Strong technical execution (code quality, incident response)
- Cross-team impact (API standards working group)
- Developed others (mentored 2 engineers, Sarah promoted)

## Strengths I've Observed

(Just jotting these down as I think of them - agents will help organize later)

- Excellent technical judgment
- Clear communicator - can explain complex things simply
- Takes ownership beyond just their tickets
- Calm under pressure
- Generous with time helping others
- Proactive about improvements (doesn't wait to be told)
- Strong systems thinking
- Collaborative - works well across teams
- Reliable - always delivers what they commit to
- Good at scoping - realistic estimates, manages expectations

---

## Areas for Development

(Discussed some of these in 1:1s)

- Could be more strategic about prioritization - sometimes takes on too much
- Would benefit from delegating more to develop others' skills
- Could have more presence in org-wide technical discussions
- Documentation sometimes comes after the fact instead of during
- Could be more vocal about technical concerns earlier

---

## Random Observations

- Works well with product - doesn't just say "no" to hard requests
- Team morale seems higher when Alex is actively involved in discussions
- Other managers have asked if Alex can help with their projects
- Very consistent performer - no real dips in quality or output
- Picks up new technologies quickly

## Tips for Your Notes

### ✅ Do This:

- **Write freely** - Don't worry about perfect grammar or structure
- **Be specific** - Use names, dates, numbers, concrete examples
- **Capture everything** - More data is better than less
- **Include URLs** - Links to work, documents, discussions
- **Note context** - What made something significant?
- **Record feedback** - Exact quotes from others when possible
- **Update continuously** - Add notes right after observations
- **Include metrics** - Numbers make impact concrete
- **Write in your own voice** - This is your working document

### ❌ Don't Worry About:

- **Perfect organization** - Agents will categorize
- **Word limits** - Write as much as you need
- **Proper categories** - Don't pre-sort into buckets
- **Polished language** - Rough notes are fine
- **Completeness of each entry** - Agents will help you add missing context
- **Rating everything** - You'll assign ratings later with Sherlock's help
- **Removing "duplicate" content** - Agents will consolidate

---

## What Happens Next

Once you have your raw notes collected, the PRM Agent workflow will guide you through:

1. **Oracle Agent** - Reads your notes and organizes the raw data
2. **Sorting Hat Agent** - Helps you categorize items (you can create custom categories!)
3. **Sherlock Agent** - Enriches each item with context, evidence, and impact ratings
4. **Shakespeare Agent** - Writes the polished review using your template and style
5. **IRS Agent** - Reviews the draft and provides critical calibration feedback

**Remember**: Your job is to capture the raw material. The agents help you refine, organize, rate, and write. Focus on **completeness** over **perfection**.

## Example of Good Raw Notes Entry

```
April 15-20: Database Performance Crisis

What happened: Database queries were getting slower over the week.
Response times went from 100ms to 800ms. Customer complaints coming in.

What Jordan did:
- Investigated on own initiative (wasn't assigned)
- Found the issue: missing index on new user_preferences table
  that product added last month
- Created fix, tested thoroughly
- Deployed during low-traffic window
- Wrote doc explaining the issue and prevention strategies
- Presented learnings in team meeting

Impact:
- Response times back to normal (95ms average)
- Prevented potential outage over weekend
- Team learned from the doc - now we have index review checklist
- PM team sent thanks via email

Quote from Sarah (teammate): "Jordan's deep understanding of our
database architecture saved us. Most people would've just filed a
ticket. Jordan owned it end-to-end."

Link to fix PR: https://github.com/company/repo/pull/2847
Link to doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/prevent123
Link to PM email: https://email/thread/thanks456

My observation: This showed great ownership, technical depth,
communication skills, and proactive problem-solving. Jordan didn't
wait for permission - just saw a problem and fixed it. Then made
sure the team learned from it. This is exactly the kind of behavior
we want to see.
```

This single entry captures: what happened, specific actions, measurable impact, feedback from others, links for evidence, and your own assessment. Perfect raw material for the agents to work with!

## Final Reminder

**Your notes don't need to be perfect. They need to be complete.**

Capture everything. Write in whatever format works for you. The PRM Agent workflow will help you transform these raw notes into a polished, defensible, high-quality performance review.

The agents are here to help you organize, analyze, and write. You're here to observe and capture. Together, you'll create an exceptional review.
